<h1 id="frequentlyaskedquetions">Frequently Asked Quetions</h1>
<h2 id="designphilosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>OpenNovel consists of expertise of parallel processing and low power programming.</p>
<p>Our first motivation of the development of this software is a lack of OSS visual novel engines which run well on smartphones.
The development was not so easy but we achieved "runs well on smartphones". </p>
<p>Smartphones have very low computer performances as they don't have cooling fans.
They have about 1/100 performance comparing to PC.
For example, assume that a rendering process can be done by a PC CPU with no problem.
That process may be done by a smartphone CPU in a short period,
but a few seconds later, it will be not properly done due to thermal throttling.
Such performance problem can be solved by a usage of GPU.
On the other hand, GPU proformances very differ on Android and iPhone.</p>
<p>Our method is a hybrid of CPU and GPU.
It renders the first and the last frames of a cross-fading by CPU, and interpolates them by GPU.
It utilizes CPU in a short period, and utilizes GPU with very low workload.</p>

<h3 id="whatarethefeaturesofopennovel">What are the features of OpenNovel?</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenNovel is one of the leading novel engines for iOS and Android;<ul>
<li>On smartphones, OpenNovel does not employ Unity or other third-party engines;</li>
<li>OpenNovel provides a Unity version to enable home game console porting.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="isitpossibletoswitchtoopennovelfromotherengines">Is it possible to switch to OpenNovel from other engines?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switching works best if one plans to make creations for iOS and Android only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wherecanworksmadewithopennovelbepublished">Where can works made with OpenNovel be published?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Windows / Web browsers
  <ul>
    <li>For beginners, OpenNovel recommends “<a href="https://freem.ne.jp/change_language/change/en" target="_blank">Freem!</a>”;</li>
    <li>For advanced users, OpenNovel recommends publishing on “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com" target="_blank">Steam</a>” (Windows) and “<a href="https://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a>” (Web browsers);</li>
    <li>If a submitted project does not break any website rules, it should be eagerly accepted there.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>iPhone / iPad / Vision Pro
    <ul>
      <li>1. One may install an app on an Apple ID device (through Apple Development);</li>
      <li>2. If a device ID is registered in advance, one may install an app with AirDrop for up to 100 devices (through Ad Hoc);</li>
      <li>3. App Store publishing requires a comprehensive review of app contents by Apple (through App Store Connect).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Android
    <ul>
      <li>An APK file may be uploaded to a suitable location (such as Google Drive) as an independent app;</li>
      <li>It takes confirmations of many app testers to release one’s app on Google Play Store.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Home game consoles
    <ul>
      <li>Register as a developer on game console websites and submit your work;</li>
      <li>When filling out an application, specify “Unity” in the required “Middleware” and “Game Engine” fields;
</li>
      <li>Obtain a Unity release made for game consoles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="canfeaturesofotherenginesbeimplementedinopennovel">Can features of other engines be implemented in OpenNovel?</h3>
<p>
  That depends: For example, PCs are usually a hundred times more powerful than smartphones, thus, certain features must not be implemented in consideration of software porting.
</p>
<h2 id="creatingworkswithopennovel">Creating Works With OpenNovel</h2>
<h3 id="canmultiplecharactersbedisplayedonascreen">Can multiple characters be displayed on a screen?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>That can be achieved through OpenNovel rendering system called <a href="ciel.html">Ciel</a> (similar to YU-RIS/ERIS engine);</li>
  <li>For those who find Ciel too complicated, <a href="reference.html#chch"><code>@chch</code></a>  command should be used instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="canamessageboxstaydisplayedwhileacharacterischanged">Can a message box stay displayed while a character is changed?</h3>
<p>
  Change =0 to =1 in the project.txt file (as in the following example):

<pre><code>msgbox.show.on.ch=1</code></pre>
<h3 id="canacharactersfacebedisplayednexttoamessagebox">Can a character’s face be displayed next to a message box?</h3>
<p>
  An image of a character can be displayed at a special position via <code>face</code> instruction. Note that fade-in&nbsp;/&nbsp;fade-out time specifications are ignored for such images.
</p>
<pre><code>@ch face filename.png</code></pre>
<h3 id="canfacialexpressionchangesbedoneusingonlyfaceparts">Can facial expression changes be done using only face parts?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For smartphones, such changes&nbsp;— considering loading time, memory use, and composing time&nbsp;— may be impracticable, therefore, these features have not been implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resolvingfontchangeissues">Resolving font change issues:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A font file name is recorded in the saved data, which may cause problems (such as not being able to change the font, or being told that a font file&nbsp;— that should not have been specified&nbsp;— cannot be opened).</li>
  <li>This issue can be solved by closing the program, deleting “<code>save</code>” folder (saved data), and restarting the program.  </li>
